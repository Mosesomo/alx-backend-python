Python Async
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Python, asynchronous programming allows you to write concurrent code that can handle many operations at once. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks such as network requests, file I/O, and database access where waiting for external resources can significantly slow down your program.

Python provides an asyncio module for writing asynchronous code using the async and await keywords. Here's a basic overview of how async works along with some examples:

async and await:
async: This keyword is used to define a coroutine function. A coroutine is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed.
await: This keyword is used inside an async function to pause execution until an asynchronous operation is completed. It can only be used inside async functions.
