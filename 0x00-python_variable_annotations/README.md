Python variable annotation:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Python variable annotations, introduced in PEP 526, provide a way to specify the expected type of a variable. This feature is part of Python's type hinting system, which allows developers to indicate the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. Variable annotations are particularly useful for static type checkers, linters, and IDEs to catch type-related errors before runtime.

Syntax and Examples
The syntax for variable annotations is straightforward. You append a colon (:) followed by the type after the variable name. Optionally, you can also assign a value to the variable at the same time.
