Python Asynchronous Comprehension
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Asynchronous comprehensions in Python, introduced in Python 3.6, allow you to create asynchronous generators in a concise and readable manner. They are similar to regular list comprehensions but operate asynchronously, enabling you to perform asynchronous operations and await results within the comprehension.
This is an implementation of the `async` keyword in Python 3.5, which allows for asynchronous comprehensions to be written using the syntax
